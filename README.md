# Micro-frontends with Web Components

Using web components as a wrapper for both Angular and React components, I am going to show them working alongside each other in a single application. I will also pass data to both components from the parent container, and back again.

Follow the instructions below to build and serve micro-frontend components for Angular and React, and a wrapper application to compose them together and handle communication between them.
